# Smart Study Time Reminder

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about helping students manage their study time better using a simple AI based reminder idea. It gives reminders based on study habits and helps students avoid last minute stress.

## Background

Many students face problem of poor time management, specially during exams. Most of us plan to study but forget or delay it. I also faced this problem during my studies and missed revision many times.

Problems this project tries to solve:
* forgetting study schedules
* poor daily routine
* exam stress due to last minute study

This topic is important because students mental health and performance both depend on good planning.

## How is it used?

The solution can be used as a mobile or web app. User enters their daily routine and subjects. AI analyses the pattern and sends reminder when the best study time comes.

This solution is mostly needed:
* during exam time
* for online learning students
* for students with busy schedule

Main users are school and college students. The reminder should be simple and not disturbing.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data can be collected from user input like:
* study hours
* break time
* subject difficulty

AI method used is simple pattern recognition and prediction. No complex machine learning is needed at first.

Possible external data source:
[Open Education Data](https://opendata.ed.gov/)

## Challenges

This project does not solve motivation issues completely. If user ignores reminders, AI cannot force them. Also privacy of students data must be protected properly.

Ethical issue is that user data should not be shared without permission.

## What next?

In future, this project can be improved by:
* adding mood detection
* connecting with calendar apps
* better AI prediction

To move forward, I would need help in app development and basic machine learning knowledge.
